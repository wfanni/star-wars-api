# API WARS

This was a group project, in which we had to create a website where users can get information about the planets exsisting in the Star Wars Universe.

There also had to be a registration and login system and the ability to vote on the planets (just for logged in users).

We had 5 days to finish the project.

In the development we used:

**Star Wars API**

**express.js**

**axios**

**React.js**
